# Animal Species Classification Project Report

## Introduction

This report presents the results of the "Animal Species Classification" project conducted from **October 1, 2023** to **October 5, 2023**. The project aimed to develop an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify various animal species based on images.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- **Dataset:** The project utilized a custom dataset containing images of **multiple animal species**. The dataset consisted of [insert number] images across [insert number] different classes.
- **Data Preprocessing:** All images were resized to a common size of **128x128 pixels**, and pixel values were normalized to the range [0, 1]. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.

### Model Architecture

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was designed for image classification. The architecture included:
  - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
  - Max-pooling layers for down-sampling
  - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
  - Dense layers for classification
- The model was implemented using [insert deep learning framework].

## Results

Present the key findings and results of the project:

- **Accuracy:** The CNN model achieved a remarkable **validation accuracy of 92.5%** on the custom animal species dataset.
- **Training Time:** Training the model on a GPU took approximately **4 hours**.
- **Visualizations:** Visualizations of the training and validation loss and accuracy curves are provided in the appendices.

## Discussion

Discuss the implications of the results, any challenges faced during the project, and potential areas for further investigation or improvement.

- **Model Performance:** The high accuracy suggests that the CNN is effective at classifying animal species based on images, demonstrating its potential for various applications.
- **Challenges:** Fine-tuning hyperparameters and managing computational resources were key challenges during the project.

## Conclusion

Summarize the main findings and their significance in the context of the project's goals and objectives.

- The project successfully demonstrated the power of CNNs for image classification tasks, achieving competitive accuracy.
- The trained model can be applied to a wide range of real-world animal species classification problems.

## Recommendations
